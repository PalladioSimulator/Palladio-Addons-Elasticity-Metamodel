# The Scaling Policy Definition (SPD) Meta-model

This repository contains the metamodel for defining scaling policies that can be simulated in Palladio and thus help self-adaptive system architects to evaluate elasticity policies more efficiently. 

# Compatibility with other tools
Other tools build upon the meta-model and the meta-model is in the inception phase, hence it is evolving and being refactored. To help you understand which tool works with which version we rely on tags for now. 

## Graphical Syntax for SPD -> supports the meta-model definition tagged v0.1  

## Slingshot Simulator -> supports tag v0.2
